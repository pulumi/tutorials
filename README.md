# Pulumi Tutorials

This repository contains hands-on tutorials to guide you to using Pulumi build, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure and applications

## Modules

- [**Introduction to Pulumi**](./introduction_to_pulumi): This topic introduces the key concepts of state, using familiar programming languages and tools, and deploying and configuring resources. You will learn how Pulumi imperative languages in a declarative model through the use of inputs and outputs in the asynchronous environment of the cloud.

- **Pulumi in Practice**: In this second module, users will learn using examples that match a real-world workflow. 

- Pulumi in Operation: This module helps users learn how to manage and operate Pulumi in their organization and team.

- **Automation API**: This module demonstrates how to use Automation API to automate cloud engineering tasks.

- **Pulumi Multi-Language Components**: This module shows how to build reusable Pulumi multi-lange components that let you author a component in one language and use it with another language. For example, author a component in Typescript and let developers use it in Python.

## How to Use the Tutorials

The first three modules are presented in order. Start with `Introduction to Pulumi` to learn how to build infrastructure. Followed this with `Pulumi in Practice` to learn how to deploy infrastructure. Complete the series with `Pulumi in Operation` to learn how to manage infrastructure.

Automation API is a stand alone module that guides you through automating deployments and building tools for managing your cloud infrastructure.

Pulumi Multi-Language Components guides you through the process of authoring components that can be used with all Pulumi supported languages.
