## Creating a Project

Infrastructure in Pulumi is organized into Projects. Each Project is a single program that, when run, declares the desired infrastructure for Pulumi to manage.

## Step 1 &mdash; Create a Directory

Each Pulumi Project lives in its own directory. Create one now and change into it:

```bash
mkdir my-first-app
cd my-first-app
```

> Pulumi will use the directory name as your project name by default. To create an independent project, simply name the directory differently.

## Step 2 &mdash; Initialize Your Project

A Pulumi Project is just a directory with some files in it. It's possible for you to create a new one by hand. The `pulumi new` command, however, automates the process:

```bash
$ pulumi new aws-python -y
This command will walk you through creating a new Pulumi project.

Enter a value or leave blank to accept the (default), and press <ENTER>.
Press ^C at any time to quit.

project name: (my-first-app)
project description: (A minimal AWS Python Pulumi program)
Created project 'my-first-app'

Please enter your desired stack name.
To create a stack in an organization, use the format <org-name>/<stack-name> (e.g. `acmecorp/dev`).
stack name: (dev)
Created stack 'dev'

aws:region: The AWS region to deploy into: (us-east-1) us-west-2
Saved config
```

This prints output similar to the following with a bit more information and status as it goes:

```
Created stack 'dev'

Creating virtual environment...

Finished creating virtual environment

Updating pip, setuptools, and wheel in virtual environment...
...
Your new project is ready to go! âœ¨

To perform an initial deployment, run 'pulumi up'
```

This command creates all the files we need, initializes a new stack named `dev` (an instance of our project), and installs the needed package dependencies from PyPi.

## Step 3 &mdash; Inspect Your New Project

Our project is comprised of multiple files:

* **`__main__.py`**: your program's main entrypoint file
* **`requirements.txt`**: your project's Python dependency information
* **`Pulumi.yaml`**: your project's metadata, containing its name and language
* **`venv`**: a [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) for your project

Run `cat __main__.py` to see the contents of your project's empty program:

```python
"""A Python Pulumi program"""

import pulumi
```

Feel free to explore the other files, although we won't be editing any of them by hand. Note that the Pulumi CLI creates a virtual environment, `venv`, for the project.
